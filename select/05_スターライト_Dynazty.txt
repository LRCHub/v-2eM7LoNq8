My downfall
I'm tripping on the edge
Push me in the back and I'll be stepping right over
Reality is tipping on it's end
Push me in the back and you'll be treading on a crack in the ice

Your silent scream it beckons to me but I'm to blind to see
Then I step into a dream
And finally your eyes fade to black and I see

The starlight within
Shining a light over my galaxy
Colors spring to life
Sending me into serenity
Yeah, the starlight within
A guider of life in a sense of divinity
And the spirit in me ceases to be
Your eyes fade to black and I see

Come nightfall
The beast again awakes
Crawling deep inside and I begin to feel the change taking over me
Stirring up a rage
Push me in the back and he'll be slipping right out of his cage

The horror scream, a catastrophe, the demon inside of me
Then I step into a dream and finally your eyes fade to black and I see

The starlight within shining a light over my galaxy
Colors spring to life
Sending me into serenity
Yeah
The starlight within
I rule over life with a sense of divinity
And the devil in me ceases to be
Your eyes fade to black and I see

Yeah
The starlight within shining a light over my galaxy
Spirits come alive
Unveiling my violent complexity
Ahh
The starlight within
A guider of life in a sense of divinity
Take me once and for all
My destiny calls
My eyes fade to black and I fall
(The starlight within)
(A guider of life in a sense of divinity)
And the spirit in me seizes to be
Your eyes fade to black and I see
